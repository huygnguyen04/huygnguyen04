## Hi there 👋, 

### I'm Huy Nguyen, a fourth-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Virginia with a minor in Applied Mathematics. 
### I am actively searching for PhD programs for this upcoming Fall 2026 cycle! I am specifically interested in research groups working on GPU architecture, memory systems, performance modeling, hardware accelerators, and reproducible benchmarking methodologies.

### [🔗 Check out my portfolio website here!](https://huygnguyen04.com/)
-------

## 📝 Academics and Research: 
- I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics.
- This Summer 2025 I have joined [Prof. Kevin Skadron](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/) LAVA Lab to research on innovating the [Rodinia Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/huygnguyen04/gpu-rodinia-v4.0).
- In my 2nd and 3rd year, I have been involved in [GPU and Computer Architecture research](https://github.com/huygnguyen04/PyTorch-CUDA-ML-Performance) at the [Insight Computer Architecture Lab](https://insight-cal.github.io/)
- I have previously work on [GPU-Accelerated Molecular Dynamics & NEP Modeling](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article/136/15/155109/3317315/Neuroevolution-machine-learning-potential-to-study) under [Prof. Keivan Esfarjani](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/keivan-esfarjani).
- I enjoy learning about GPU Programming and NVIDIA tools. 
- I love teaching and tutoring, especially being a TA for Computer Science and Applied Math courses at UVA. I am currently TA for CS 3130 - Computer Systems and Organization 
-------

## 😮 About Me: 
- I am originally from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and moved to the U.S. to pursue my studies as an international student.
- Fun fact: I can sleep up to 16 hours on weekends and stay up until 7 AM with classes starting at 9 AM. I am probably sleeping when you are reading this.
